fun project trying to create a list of 365 lyrics for a spotify account based on their most listened to songs


using the spotipy api and genius.com's api, I aim to print out 365 lyrics including the song and artist, for an individual spotify listener.
the idea is that a every day the user could get a new lyric from one of their favorite artists' songs.
